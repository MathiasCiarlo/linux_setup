# Ubuntu setup
This is my personal **very not serious** (well, a little, but expect some fun) Ubuntu installation script.
Tested on Ubuntu 16.04

## What it does
Installs must-have apps and fixes some folder structures and aliases.

## Installation:
```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MathiasCiarlo/ubuntu-setup/master/setup.sh | bash
```
or
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MathiasCiarlo/ubuntu-setup.git && bash ubuntu-setup/setup.sh
```
